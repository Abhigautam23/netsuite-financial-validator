🧾 NetSuite Financial Validator

A lightweight Python + Streamlit tool that replicates NetSuite-style Profit & Loss (P&L) reporting, validates ledger balance integrity, and visualizes financial trends from exported transaction data.

🌟 Key Features

✅ Automated Ledger Validation
Instantly checks if Income, Expense, and COGS accounts balance correctly — alerts you to any mismatched or missing journal entries.

✅ Smart Data Merging
Seamlessly merges your NetSuite transactions and accounts datasets, enriching transaction lines with account metadata.

✅ Dynamic Profit & Loss Calculation
Generates both monthly and overall P&L summaries that follow standard accounting conventions (Income as negative, Expenses and COGS as positive).

✅ Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit)
Visualize your financial trends with clear tables and line charts. Works with drag-and-drop CSV uploads — no coding required.

✅ Flexible Data Sources
Use local CSV exports or connect directly to your SQL data warehouse.
